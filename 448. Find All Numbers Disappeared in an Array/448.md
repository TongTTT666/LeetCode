# Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array #

Given an array of integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.

Find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that do not appear in this array.

Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.

**Example:**
```
Input:
[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

Output:
[5,6]
```

## 解题思路 ##
很简单的思路，为了实现O(n)，需要再开一个数组，额外消耗O(n)的空间去记录哪个数出现了哪个数没出现。


如何不开辟额外空间还能实现O(n)？

用减法！
