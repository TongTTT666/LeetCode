# Find Peak Element #

A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.

Given an input array where `num[i] ≠ num[i+1]`, find a peak element and return its index.

The array may contain multiple peaks, in that case return the index to any one of the peaks is fine.

You may imagine that `num[-1] = num[n] = -∞`.

For example, in array `[1, 2, 3, 1]`, 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
