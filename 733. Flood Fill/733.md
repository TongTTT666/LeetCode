# Flood Fill #

An `image` is represented by a 2-D array of integers, each integer representing the pixel value of the image (from 0 to 65535).

Given a coordinate `(sr, sc)` representing the starting pixel (row and column) of the flood fill, and a pixel value `newColor`, "flood fill" the image.

To perform a "flood fill", consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same color as the starting pixel), and so on. Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with the newColor.

At the end, return the modified image.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 
image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]]
sr = 1, sc = 1, newColor = 2
Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]
Explanation: 
From the center of the image (with position (sr, sc) = (1, 1)), all pixels connected 
by a path of the same color as the starting pixel are colored with the new color.
Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not 4-directionally connected
to the starting pixel.
```
**Note:**
- The length of image and image[0] will be in the range [1, 50].
- The given starting pixel will satisfy 0 <= sr < image.length and 0 <= sc < image[0].length.
- The value of each color in image[i][j] and newColor will be an integer in [0, 65535].

## 解题思路 ##
题目很简单，就跟第200题几乎一样，注意深度优先搜索和宽度优先搜索一个通过递归实现，一个通过队列实现，另外要注意对于每一个访问的点（深度优先中递归调用点，宽度优先中推入队列的点）都要标记为已访问，本题简单就在于刚好已访问的点的颜色会变化！一个变态的情况需要注意！就是如果新颜色和旧颜色一样，那就没有必要改变！直接返回image即可！
