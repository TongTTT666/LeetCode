# Ugly Number #

Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include `2, 3, 5`. For example, `6, 8` are ugly while `14` is not ugly since it includes another prime factor `7`.

Note that `1` is typically treated as an ugly number.

一关一关的过就行，如果一个数出现了同时不能被2、3、5整除的情况，则这个数就不是丑数。
